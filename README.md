## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media query

### What I learned

I continue learning and improving my css skills. A big confusion I had was to adjust or adapt the content to the correct screen size with *media query.* Its use is to adjust to different screen sizes and viewports, so anyone can browse the content (any project) from any device, be it a mobile or desktop. An update to my learning journey is that not only can I use '@media screen and (min-width:screen size)', but I can also set the media display for an adjustable min and max screen size, both in one line as the following example:

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px) {
  .layout-container {
    width: 320px;
    margin: 100px auto;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

Honestly, I've been applying all the skills I've been learning on projects like this one that FrontEnd Mentor provides to its community. I will continue to work on more projects and improve and one day share my knowledge and experience with the younger generation. 

My goal is to reach a level where I can use all three skills of HTML, CSS and JS and create an interactive portfolio website.

### Useful resources

- [How to "make a site responsive" and use Media Queries well](https://fedmentor.dev/posts/responsive-meaning/) - This helped me understand the concepts of how to make a responsive site. It really guided me on how I should start this project in the first place. So, I decided to code all the features for a mobile screen size, which I started with 375px as per the requirement of this project.

- [DevDocs API Documentation](https://devdocs.io/) - This is an amazing website which helped me finally understand some of the elements I implemented on this project. It is a easy way to learn, and I'd recommend it to anyone.

- [Web.Dev](https://web.dev/learn/css/) This is also a resourceful website that help anyone to learn css step by step with proper examples.
